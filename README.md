## Introduction
SuperCT was initially published by [Xie et al.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/8/e48/5364134), in Nucleic Acids Research Vol. 47, 2019. This repo presents a modified version of SuperCT for supervised single-cell clustering. We have tested B, M, and T cells clustering with the implemented model on an industrial dataset and achieved 99.28% accuracy during testing.
